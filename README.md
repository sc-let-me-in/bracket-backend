# bracket-backend

In order to run this backend, you will need a spotify API key configured with the correct environment variables. Set
`SPOTIFY_ID` and `SPOTIFY_SECRET` with the corresponding values to be able to run the application

## Getting Started
1. ```go get github.com/shit-city/bracket-backend```

2. ```go run main.go```

And you're good to go! The API should be up at localhost:8000. For now you can only test it by plugging in a song id to get
some basic info about the song.
